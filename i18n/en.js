  'python.ghost_clue1.Sage of Significant Whitespace': `Thank you, initiate, for observing our sacred traditions. In life, I
  would extoll the virtues of significant whitespace, and help my charges 
  cast off the shackles of curly braces and line terminators.<br/><br/>
  Today, I leave you with my knowledge, and one step closer to the prize 
  that you seek. May you always walk the path of the Fullstack.`,
  'python.ghost_clue2.Sage of Incompatible Versions': `The great schism of Python 2.7 to Python 3 was a trying time for us all.
  Initiates required great courage and fortitude to persevere through the 
  bugs and frustrations of this breaking change.<br/><br/>
  I sense the same determination in you, initiate. Go with my knowledge,
  and may the Wise Mother coil around you in your time of need.`,
  'python.ghost_clue3.Sage of List Comprehensions': `I simply cannot abide the presence of unsightly <em>for</em> loops.
  Ghastly things. That is why I gifted initiates with list comprehension,
  so their code can be as terse as an emotionally distant parent.<br/><br/>
  But alas, our conversation has gone on too long. Go with my knowledge,
  and the blessings of the Fullstack.`,
  'python.ghost_clue4.Sage of the Novice': `It has always been a source of pride that Python is a popular choice 
  for new developers. I kept a grand journal of every programmer whose first 
  line of code was in Python, and it stretched to the depths of the temple.
  <br/><br/>
  No matter how far you go, always remember what it felt like as a newcomer,
  and do all you can to aid the beginner. Blessings of the Fullstack be 
  upon you.`,
  'python.ghost_clue5.Sage of Vim and Vigor': `In my mortal form, I got so excited when writing a new program, that I
  needed to slow down a bit! Typing <em>:wq!</em> to exit and save a file

  <br/><br/>
  Even if you don't embrace the <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim 
  lifestyle</a>, you're okay in my book. Go get that staff!`,
  'python.ghost_clue6.Sage of Virtual Environmentalism': `My most holy charge is to impress upon initiates the need to protect 
  their Python environment. You won't be asked to master it yet, but 
  know that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">
  virtual environments</a> will help you bring order to chaos.

  Go, then. I have my doubts, but you may yet prove to be a worthy Python 
  developer. Blessings of the Fullstack be upon you.`,
  'python.ghost_clue7.Sage of the Package Index': `No Pythonista is an island, my friend. Know that you are not the first 
  to walk this path, and if the Fullstack is kind, you won't be the last.
  <br/><br/>
  In my time, initiates learned from me that the 
  <a href="https://pypi.org/">package index</a> could be a source of
  comfort and strength, drawing upon the wisdom of the ages. May it serve 
  you as it has those who came before.`,
